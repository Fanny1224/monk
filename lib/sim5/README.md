# SIM5

SIM5 is a library with a collection of routines for relativistic raytracing and radiation transfer in GR. MONK uses some of its routines and contains a copy of the library source files.

If you want to explore this library and use it separately, check out [SIM5 repository ](https://github.com/mbursa/sim5).
